# distilroberta-base-sst-2-distilled

This is the distilled version of the [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/textattack/roberta-base-SST-2) model fine-tuned on the SST-2 part of the GLUE dataset. It was obtained from the "teacher" RoBERTa model by using task-specific knowledge distillation. Since it was fine-tuned on the SST-2, the final model is ready to be used in sentiment analysis tasks.

## Comparison to the original RoBERTa model:


The final distilled model was able to achieve 92% accuracy on the SST-2 dataset. Given the original RoBERTa achieves 94.8% accuracy on the same dataset with much more parameters (125M) and that this distilled version is nearly twice as fast as it is, the accuracy is impressive.

## Usage

To use the model from the ðŸ¤—/transformers library

```python
# !pip install transformers

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("azizbarank/distilroberta-base-sst2-distilled")

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("azizbarank/distilroberta-base-sst2-distilled")
```
